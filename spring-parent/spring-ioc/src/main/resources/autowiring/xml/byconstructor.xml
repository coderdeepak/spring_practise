		Employee is now declared autowired by constructor; you don't need to explicitly write the configuration of injecting the constructor argument.
		Employee class has a constructor which contains an argument of type department; as you can see we have not explicitly mentioned the injection of constructor argument
		but since employee is autowired by constructor , spring container will auto detect Department bean and inject it as constructor argument in employee class.
